  Welcome to the brand new Intro to Computer Science course at Leaders High School! This will be a hands-on project-based course where you will learn how to build your own computer games.

  Objectives
</h3>

<p>
This course has five main components:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <h4>Programming Fundamentals:</h4>
    The first thing to understand is that computers aren't complicated. They are actually really dumb, and programming is all about dumbing down tasks into simple language that a computer can understand. It's like how you would have to give driving directions in the most basic turn-by-turn steps for an out-of-town driver, when you just tell a taxi driver "go to the airport." There are surprisingly few things computers can understand, which luckily means there are only a few concepts that you need to know to be able to tell a computer what to do. These are things like variable, conditional, loop, and function. 

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Build Your Own Blocks:</h4>
    BYOB is a graphical computer language that represents the basic building blocks on computer programs as actual blocks. You create programs by stacking and arranging blocks in a particular order. (<a href="http://byob.berkeley.edu/">BYOB</a> is an offshoot of MIT's <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. There is also a web version of BYOB called <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run">Snap</a>. The desktop application that we will be using in class is free, so go ahead and download a copy for your home computer if you have one: <a href="http://byob.berkeley.edu/BYOB%203.1.1%20Mac.zip">mac download</a>, <a href="http://byob.berkeley.edu/BYOB%203.1.1%20Setup.exe">windows download</a>.)
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
    Once you understand the basic concepts that a computer understands and how to represent those in BYOB, you will need to be able to break a problem down into those simple parts. There will be numerous ways to do this, and some will be better than others. We will teach you how to compare and assess different approaches to the same problem. As you make more complex programs, you will begin to see the need for pre-planning and incremental testing of your program. We will try to start you off with good practices for you to use as you move on to bigger and bigger projects.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Creativity:</h4> 
    Programming is the perfect way to let your creativity loose. You are working in digital environment where ideas can be tested quickly, mistakes can be undone, and there are limitless possibilities to what you can make. There will be plenty of opportunities to mix art, game design, story telling, and music into your projects. The beauty of computer science is how applicable it is in every field. We want you to personalize your projects and incorporate your outside interests.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Computing and Society:</h4> 
    Having the ability to think through the consequences of technological development is tremendously important for you as a programmer and creator of technology. Sometimes it is hard to take a step back to analyze what has changed in the midst of a constant stream of development. Part of this class will be focused on examining case studies and current events to discuss the societal and ethical impacts of technology.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"></span></a>
  Projects
</h3>

<p>
  The majority of this class will take place in the computer lab. Each day will consist of a lab assignment, which is a small programming project that can be completed in class that day. There are also four major projects throughout the semester:
  <li>
    Project 1: Mario
  </li>

  <li>
    Project 2: 
  </li>

  <li>
    Project 3: 
  </li>

  <li>
    Project 4: Your pick!
  </li>
</p>

<h3><a name="collaboration" class="anchor" href="#collaboration"></span></a>
  Collaboration
</h3>

<p>
  Most assignments for this class will be individual assignments, but collaboration with your classmates will be a valueable tool in problem solving when you get stuck or need to brainstorm ideas. We encourage sharing and discussion during labs, but we would never want colloboration to interfere with your ability to construct your own unique solutions to programming problems. This class will be only be fun to the extent that you can incorporate your creatvity and personal interests into the programs you build. Not only would copying someone else's work be boring, but it would also be obvious to graders. Given the open-ended nature of thse assignments, the programs submitted for the same project will end up vastly different from one another. We are excited to see all of the wild things that you come up with.
</p>

<h3><a name="experience-points" class="anchor" href="#experience-points"></span></a>
  Experience Points
</h3>

<p>
  Your grade in this class will reflect how well your assignments meet the requirements, but we also hope that some assignments will spark your imagination and desire to create something original. You will learn more and enjoy the class more if you can find ways to add personality to your projects. We want students to feel challenged in this course but also give them enough leeway to move at the pace that is comfortable to them. To incentivise praise worthy things that fall outside of the scope of grades, we will give out Experience Points. A running tally of Experience Points will be maintained throughout the semester and leaderboards posted showing the students with the most points for that week and the most points cummulatively. At the end of the semester, prizes will be given to the students that have earned the most experience points throughout the semester. We will also hold raffles periodically for smaller prizes where raffle tickets can be redeemed from Experience Points. You can earn points from a variety of things, e.g. finding a particularly clever solutions to a programming problem, going above and beyond in assignments, writing a computer and society report on a current event article, helping classmates and demonstrating mature collaboration, and learning about more topics in computer science outside of course requirements. Experience points will be given out if teachers recognize experience point worthy actions, and there will be a list of tasks you can do to earn additional experience points.
