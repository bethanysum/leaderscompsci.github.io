<h3><a name="section-1" class="anchor" href="#section-1"></span></a>
  Welcome to the brand new Intro to Computer Science course at Leaders High School! This will be a hands-on project-based course where you will learn how to build your own computer games.

<h3><a name="objectives" class="anchor" href="#objectives"></span></a>
  This course has five main components:
</h3>

<ul>

  <li>
    <h4>Programming Fundamentals</h4>
    <p>
    The first thing to understand about programming is that computers actually really dumb, and programming is all about breaking down tasks into simple language that computers can understand. You could just tell a taxi driver to “go to the airport”, but you would have to break that down into the most basic turn-by-turn directions for an out-of-town driver. It’s the same idea. There are only a few concepts that computers can understand, like variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. Luckily this means you only need to learn a few things to get started programming.
    </p>

    <h4>BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks)</h4>
    <p>
    The fundamental concepts mentioned above are the building blocks for creating all computer applications. In this class you will learn how to code using <a href="http://byob.berkeley.edu/">BYOB</a>, which represents those concepts as literal blocks that you can move around and stack together. BYOB is a graphical computer language, which does much of the same things as a typical text based language but with more ease and less typing. (BYOB is an offshoot of MIT's <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. There is also a web version of BYOB called <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run">Snap</a>. All of these are free, so go ahead and try running them on your home computer if you have one.)
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
    <p>
    Understanding the basic concepts and how to represent those in BYOB is not enough if you don’t know how to break a problem down into those basic parts. There will be numerous ways to break down a problem, and some are better than others. We will teach you how to evaluate multiple approaches to the same problem. As you begin to construct more complex programs, you will also begin to recognize the need for pre-planning and incremental testing. We will try to start you off with good practices for you to use as you move on to bigger and better projects.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Creativity</h4>
    <p>
    Coding is the perfect way to let your creativity loose. You will be working in digital environment where ideas can be tested quickly, mistakes can be undone, limitless possibilities for what you can make. This course will present plenty of opportunities to include art, game design, story telling, and music to your projects. We invite you to mix in any other outside interests that you can.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Computing and Society</h4>
    <p>
    As a programmer and creator of technology, it is important for you to examine the consequences of technological development. Part of this class will focus on discussing current events and the societal and ethical implications of technology.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"></span></a>
  Projects
</h3>

<p>
  The majority of this class will take place in the computer lab. Each day will consist of a lab assignment, which is a small programming project that can be completed in class that day. There will also be four major projects throughout the semester:
  <li>
    Project 1: Mario
  </li>

  <li>
    Project 2: Space Invaders
  </li>

  <li>
    Project 3: Hangman
  </li>

  <li>
    Project 4: Your pick!
  </li>
</p>

<h3><a name="collaboration" class="anchor" href="#collaboration"></span></a>
  Collaboration
</h3>

<p>
  Labs and projects will be individual assignments, but collaboration with your classmates will be a valuable resource for problem solving when you get stuck or need to brainstorm ideas. We encourage sharing and discussion during lab time but not to the point where it could interfere with developing of your own unique solutions to problems. This class will be fun to the extent that you incorporate your creativity into the programs you build. Copying someone else's work would not only be boring but obvious to graders.
</p>

<h3><a name="experience-points" class="anchor" href="#experience-points"></span></a>
  Experience Points
</h3>

<p>
  We want this course to give you enough flexibility to explore areas of computer science that interest you at a comfortable yet challenging pace. Since this is unique to each student, we want to offer additional incentives for taking personal initiative. Throughout the course we will be giving out Experience Points for exceptional things we notice in assignments or in the classroom. We will also post a list of things that you can do to earn additional points, e.g. learning how to count in binary, taking a codecademy course, or writing a computing and society critique of a current event. We will keep a running tally of Experience Points and post leader boards for students with the most points that week and cumulatively. Periodically we will hold raffles for prizes where points can be used as tickets. At the end of the semester bigger prizes will be awarded to the students with the most cumulative points.
