<h2>
  Lab: Using Lists
</h2>

<p>In this lab, you will use your new knowledge of lists to build two functions: <b>maximum of</b> and <b>average of</b>.</p>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open up BYOB to create a new file.</li>

  <li>
    <p>Create a block that will find the maximum number in a list, called <b>maximum of</b>. Make sure it's a <b>reporter</b>, in the <b>operator</b> category, and that it <b>accepts one argument</b>.</p>
    <p>Write the code inside of the block definition; it should be almost identical to the "mimimum" function that was constructed in class today. Just as a reminder, you will need to create <b>two variables</b> and your code will involve the <b>repeat</b> block.</p>
    <p>When you've written the block, make sure to test it in a variety of inputs. Can you think of special inputs that would be useful to test <b>for experience points!</b></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a block that will find the average of the numbers in a list, called <b>average of</b>. Make sure it's a <b>reporter</b>, in the <b>operator</b> category, and that it <b>accepts one argument</b>.</p>
    <p>Write the code inside of the block definition; it should be <b>very similar</b> to the minimum and maximum functions, but with code to sum up numbers instead of checking and setting values. Just as a reminder, you will need to create <b>two variables</b> and your code will involve the <b>repeat</b> block.</p>
    <p>When you've written the block, make sure to test it in a variety of inputs. Can you think of special inputs that would be useful to test <b>for experience points!</b></p>
  </li>

  <li>Once you've completed your lab, save your BYOB file and email it as an attachment to <a href="mailto:help@leaderscompsci.com">help@leaderscompsci.com</a>.</li>
