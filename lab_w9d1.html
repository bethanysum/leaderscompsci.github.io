<h2>
  Lab: Different Block Types in BYOB
</h2>

<p>In this lab, you will use your new knowledge of block types to build a command block, a reporter block, and a predicate block.</p>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open up BYOB to create a new file.</li>

  <li>Create a block that draws a polygon with a variable number of sides, and a variable side length. Your block should look like this: <img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/prog/polyblock.png" /></li>

  <li>Create a block that calculates the minimum of two numbers ("min of __ and __").</li>

  <li>Create a block that says whether a number is between two other numbers. Your block should look like this: <img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/prog/between.png" /></li>

  <li>Once you've completed your lab, save your BYOB file and email it as an attachment to <a href="mailto:help@leaderscompsci.com">help@leaderscompsci.com</a>.</li>

</ol>
